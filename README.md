# project-euler
These are my Project Euler solutions in ***vanilla JavaScript***. I have noticed many Project Euler solutions in JS take advantage of external libraries. To exercise algorithmic thinking, I never take shortcuts by using any external libraries.

Each file includes the question prompt and a brief description of my approach. I have also added the execution time for every solution.
